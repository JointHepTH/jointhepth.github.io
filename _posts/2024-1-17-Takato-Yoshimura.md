Title: New classical integrable systems from generalized TTbar-deformation    
Abstract: I will talk about the generalized TTbar-deformation for classical free particles and show that it yields a novel class of classical integrable many-body systems that are Bethe solvable, which we dub ``semiclassical Bethe systems''. A large degree of freedom in the deformations also implies that the phase shift of the resulting model can take an almost arbitrary functional form subject to minor constraints. I will show that the thermodynamics of the semiclassical Bethe systems is described by thermodynamic Bethe ansatz and, in particular, even at finite volume, that the thermodynamics is still captured by TBA-like equations. Finally, I will discuss that the generalized hydrodynamics emerges at large space-time scales.
