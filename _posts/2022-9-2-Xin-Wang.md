Title: Wilson Loops and Topological Strings  
Abstract: It was known for decades that the topological strings on non-compact Calabi-Yau threefolds capture the BPS states of 5d N=1 supersymmetric quantum field theories on R^4\times S^1. However, for the Wilson loop observables in the 5d N=1 SQFTs, the refined topological string correspondence was not known until quite recently. In this talk, I will give the M-theory perspective of the half-BPS Wilson loop observables and I will then describe the refined topological vertex method and the refined holomorphic anomaly equation method in topological string theory, from which we have exact computations on the 5d Wilson loops partition functions in both A- and B-models.
