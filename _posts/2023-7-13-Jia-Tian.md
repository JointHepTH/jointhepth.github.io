Title: On-shell action and entanglement entropy of TTbar-deformed holographic CFTs  
Abstract: In this work, we study the holographic dual of the \ttbar deformation following the mixed boundary condition proposal. We point out that a boundary term should be included in the gravity action in the holographic dictionary. We show some evidence that this boundary term will modify the RT formula. In particular, we consider the deformed CFT defined on a sphere (dS) or AdS background and explain the difference between the holographic results and field theory results.
