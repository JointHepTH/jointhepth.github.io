Title: Multi-level images around Kerr-Newman black holes  
Abstract: In this talk, I will talk about the lensing effects of Kerr-Newman (KN) black holes and the multi-level images of luminous sources around the black holes. I will first introduce the analytic forms of the lens equations in KN spacetime before introducing the limiting forms of these lens equations for photon emissions near the bounded photon orbits. Meanwhile, I will introduce the three key parameters γ, δ and τ, which respectively correspond to the demagnification, rotation and time delay between successive images. Then I will discuss the primary, the secondary and the higher-order images of spherical sources and equatorial disk-like sources. I will end up with some closing remarks.
