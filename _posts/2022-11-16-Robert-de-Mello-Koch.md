Title: Holography of Information in AdS/CFT  
Abstract: The principle of the holography of information states that in a theory of quantum gravity a copy of all the information available on a Cauchy slice is also available near the boundary of the Cauchy slice. This redundancy in the theory is already present at low energy. In the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence, this principle can be translated into a statement about the dual conformal field theory. We carry out this translation and demonstrate that the principle of the holography of information holds in the setting of the duality between the free O(N) vector model and higher spin gravity.
