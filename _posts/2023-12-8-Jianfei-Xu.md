Title: Warped Symmetries of Rotating Black Holes    
Abstract: In this talk, we will first review the holographic descriptions of Kerr black holes from the aspects of warped conformal symmetries. We will use the warped symmetries to fix the Green's function and the absorption probability for the scalar and higher spin perturbations on a generic non-extreme Kerr background. Then we will generalize the discussion to the accelerating Kerr black hole case. We will show the construction of the warped conformal algebra in the covariant phase space near the black hole bifurcation surface. Given the central terms in the warped conformal algebra, the thermal entropy formula of a warped CFT fixed by modular parameters and vacuum charges then can be used to reproduces the entropy of the rotating black hole with acceleration.
