Speaker: Yunqin Zheng (IPMU & ISSP U. Tokyo)  
Title: Non-invertible Duality Defects: Lattice, Field Theory and Symmetry  
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed an explosion of studies of the non-invertible symmetries in various dimensions. In this talk, I will revisit the most vanilla type of non-invertible symmetry â€” Kramers-Wannier duality symmetry in (1+1)d, from three different perspectives: 1. lattice; 2. field theory; 3. Symmetry TFT.   
This talk is based on a work in collaboration with Justin Kaidi and Kantaro Ohmori [2209.11062], and an upcoming work with Linhao Li and Masaki Oshikawa.  

Date & Time: 3:00 PM, Nov 2, 2022.
