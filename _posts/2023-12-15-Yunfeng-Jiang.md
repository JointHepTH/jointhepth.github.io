Title: Giant correlators at Quantum Levels    
Abstract: In this talk, I will first review the progress and state-of-the art of the computation of four-point functions of single-trace BPS operators in N=4 SYM theory. I will then report new results on four-point functions involving giant gravitons up to three-loop order at weak coupling. From the four-point function, we can extract new OPE data, which exhibit intriguingly simple relations between the OPE data of single trace operators.
