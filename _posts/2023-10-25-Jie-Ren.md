Title: Analytic solutions for quasinormal modes and scalar condensation in AdS  
Abstract: (1) Explicit solutions of black hole quasinormal modes are rare. In the first part of the talk, I will present an analytic solution of a holographic thermal correlator that shows how the poles move and how a branch cut emerges as the temperature varies. (2) It is well known that the AdS black holes can develop scalar hair spontaneously, and an example is holographic superconductors, which have been intensely studied during the past 15 years. However, exact, analytic solutions of either the background geometry dual to the superconducting phase or the frequency-dependent conductivity are rare. The phase transition is triggered by a zero mode, which is the solution to a QNM equation at $\omega=0$, and is usually not analytically available. In the second part of the talk, I will present a class of analytic solutions for scalar condensation in AdS, and discuss their applications: one is holographic superconductors at zero density, and the other is phase transitions of Renyi entropies.
