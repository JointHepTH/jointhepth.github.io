Title: Non-local operators and flavored modular differential equations    
Abstract: The Schur index of a 4d $\mathcal{N} = 2$ SCFT counts the gauge-invariant Schur operators in the theory, and is identified with vacuum character of the associated chiral algebra. Non-local BPS operators can be inserted and the defect Schur index/correlators can be defined. In this talk we will discuss the exact computation of these quantities using some integration formula, which manifests their modular property. These quantities are believed to be related to the module characters of the chiral algebra, and in the talk we will show in examples that they solve the flavored modular differential equations from the null states in the algebra. Using these equations, we will demonstrate an interesting modular property among null states that strongly constrains the chiral algebra.
