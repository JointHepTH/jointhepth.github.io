Title: Yang-Baxter solutions from commuting operators    
Abstract: We construct R-matrices (with a multidimensional spectral parameter) that include additive as well as non-additive parameters. They satisfy the colored Yang-Baxter equation.
The solutions depend on a set of commuting operators. They change with the representation of the latter. The associated Yang-Baxter algebra and the spectrum of the transfer matrix are also studied.
