Title: TTbar-deformation of supersymmetric quantum mechanics  
Abstract: In this talk, I will talk about an explicitly supersymmetric  deformation of supersymmetric quantum mechanics. First we will visit a class of (0+1)-dimensional  or  theories, including the super-Schwarzian theory dual to JT supergravity. These deformations are written in terms of Noether currents associated with translations in superspace, so we refer to them as  deformations. Then we show that the  deformations of  and  theories are on-shell equivalent to the dimensionally reduced supercurrent-squared deformations of 2d  and  theories, respectively. In the  case, we present two forms of the  deformation which drive the same flow. This is based on joint work arXiv:2204.05897 with S. Ebert, C. Ferko, and Z. Sun.
