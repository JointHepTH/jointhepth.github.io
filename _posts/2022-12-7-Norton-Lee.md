Speaker: Norton Lee (IBS)  
Title: Defect in Gauge Theory and Quantum Hall States  
Abstract: The quantum Hall states describing the gas of interacting electrons in two dimensional surface in the presence of strong magnetic field are related to the partition function of half-BPS surface defects of N=2 supersymmetric gauge theory in four dimensions.  
We identify various fractional quantum Hall states, including Laughlin, Moore-Read, and Read-Rezayi states, with the partition function of different arrangement of two types of surface defects introduced to the N=2* U(N) gauge theory in four dimensions.
