Title: Holographic thermodynamics and holographic complexity of rotating black holes    
Abstract: I will talk about the holographic properties of rotating Kerr Anti-de Sitter black holes, including their thermodynamics and generalized complexity. Initially, I will demonstrate that the dual conformal field theory (CFT) states corresponding to the four-dimensional rotating black holes exhibit first-order phase transitions and criticality within the canonical ensemble. Moreover, the Hawking-Page-like phase transition occurs in the grand canonical ensemble. Subsequently, I will explore the bulk codimensional-one observables of the higher-dimensional rotating black holes to reveal multiple spurious phase transitions in the context of the generalized holographic complexity.
