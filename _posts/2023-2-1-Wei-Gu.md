Speaker: Wei Gu (MPIM-Bonn)  
Title: Heisenberg Spin Chains And Supersymmetric Gauge Theories  
Abstract: In this talk, we will  present how a Heisenberg spin chain emerges from the two-dimensional N=(2,2) gauge theory at an intermediate scale, which relies on the renormalization group flow guided by the global symmetries and the dynamics of domain walls.   Two examples will be discussed: XX-model and its K-theoretic version. Finally, we will briefly comment on the unification of gauge theories from the point of view of spin chain, and how to approach other formulations of an integrable system via a new point of view.
