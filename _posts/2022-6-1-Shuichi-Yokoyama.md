Title: Special flow equation and GKP-Witten relation  
Abstract: I will speak about my recent work on a new framework for the reconstruction of bulk theory dual to conformal field theory (CFT) by means of flow equation. A flow equation generally describes a non-local course-graining of elementary fields consisting of given quantum field theory so as to remove the contact divergence. This property of the flow equation enables one to construct a class of composite operators which behave as geometric objects including metric in the holographic space after taking the quantum average. In this talk I will explain a certain extension from the free flow equation, which we call a special flow equation. Using the special flow equation, the conformal transformation for a normalized smeared operator exactly becomes the isometry of anti-de Sitter space (AdS). By employing this special flow equation with O(N) vector models, we explicitly show that the AdS geometry as well as the scalar field satisfying the GKP-Witten relation concurrently emerge in this framework.
