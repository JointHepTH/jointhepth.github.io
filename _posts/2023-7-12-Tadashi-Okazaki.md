Title: 4d N=2* Schur indices and line operators  
Abstract: We study the exact closed-form expressions for the Schur indices and correlation functions of line operators of 4d N=4 and N=2* U(N) super Yang-Mills theory in the canonical and grand canonical ensembles via the Fermi-gas method. They are expressible in terms of the (twisted) Weierstrass functions and the (generalized) Kronecker theta series. We also discuss the holographic dual and combinatorial aspects of these observables. The talk will be based on https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.01426 and https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14887 .
