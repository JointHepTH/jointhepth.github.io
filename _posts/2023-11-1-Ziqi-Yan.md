Speaker: Ziqin Yan (Nordita)  
Title: Unification of Decoupling Limits in String Theory  
Abstract: I will introduce a duality web that unifies different decoupling limits of type II superstring theories, including Matrix theories (BFSS, IKKT, etc.), tensionless/ambitwistor and nonrelativistic string theory. This duality web also reveals new decoupling limits of string/M-theory that are related to Carrollian strings and Spin Matrix theories (near BPS limits of N=4 super Yang-Mills). I will show how to uplift these corners to M-theory. I will also discuss potential implications of this unifying perspective for the AdS/CFT correspondence and flat space holography.
