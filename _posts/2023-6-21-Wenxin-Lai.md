Title: Glue-on AdS holography for TTbar-deformed CFTs    
Abstract: The TTbar deformation is a solvable irrelevant deformation whose properties depend on the sign of the deformation parameter μ. In particular, TTbar-deformed CFTs with μ<0 have been proposed by McGough, Mezei and H. Verlinde to be holographically dual to Einstein gravity with a finite Dirichlet cutoff.

In this work, we put forward a holographic proposal for TTbar-deformed CFTs with μ>0, in which case the bulk dual geometry is constructed by gluing a patch of AdS3 to the original spacetime. We provide various evidence for this extended holography, including matches of the TTbar trace flow equation, the spectrum, and the partition function on the bulk and the boundary.
