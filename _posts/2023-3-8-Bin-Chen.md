Speaker: Bin Chen (Peking U.)  
Title:  On emergent conformal symmetry near the photon ring  
Abstract: The (emergent) conformal symmetry plays an essential role in finding the holographic pictures of black hole. In this talk, after reviewing the study of (hidden) conformal symmetry in black hole physics, I will introduce our recent construction of the emergent near-ring conformal symmetry.
