Title: Integrable three-point functions in ABJM theory  
Abstract:  I will discuss the integrable three-point functions of two sub-determinant operators and a single-trace operator in ABJM theory. In the first part of my talk, I will introduce how to reduce the three-point functions to an overlap between a Bethe state and a matrix product state at weak coupling. We find some selection rules for the overlap and give a conjecture of the overlap formula. In the second part of my talk, I will prove the matrix product state in the previous part is integrable and the selection rules can be derived directly from the integrable boundary condition. Subsequently, I will generalize the method to some more general matrix product state. In the third part of my talk, I will explain the holographic computation by using the giant gravitons. I will point out two important effects that were missed in the previous literature.
