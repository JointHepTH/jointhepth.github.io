Title: On Topological Defect Lines in Para-fermionic CFTs  
Abstract: In recent years, our understanding on symmetries has been greatly evolved in terms of topological defect surfaces in QFTs of various dimensions. In this talk, I will discuss the features of a class of topological defect lines (TDLs) which correspond to (non-invertible) 0-form or 1-form symmetries in 2d para-fermionic CFTs or 3d anyon theories respectively. The talk is three-folded. First, TDLs can be studied in a pure 2d CFT perspective via a bottom-up approach; On the other hand, we can lift the TDLs into 3d anyon theories and understand them from the viewpoint of para-fermionic condensation in a top-down way; In addition, I will also explain the mathematical structures behind the TDLs in para-fermion/anyon theories, in terms of a generalized fusion category, Zn para-fusion categories.
