Title: Brane transport in non-abelian GLSM    
Abstract: We studied the window shift monodromy in determinantal varieties realized by a GLSM with two gauge groups with a proposed non-abelian window of grassmannian using disk partition function and grade restriction. We obtained the link group decomposition if discriminants in Kahler moduli space and the corresponding massless BPS states for this model.
