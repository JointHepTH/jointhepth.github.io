Speaker: Zihan Zhou (Princeton U.)  
Title: Love Numbers From Amplitudes  
Abstract: In this talk, I will extract the black hole (BH) static tidal deformability coefficients (Love numbers) and their spin-0 and spin-1 analogs by comparing on-shell amplitudes for fields to scatter off a spinning BH in the worldline effective field theory (EFT) and in general relativity (GR). I will show that the GR amplitudes due to tidal effects originate entirely from the BH potential region. Thus, they can be separated from gravitational non-linearities in the wave region, whose proper treatment requires higher order EFT loop calculations. This method provides a gauge-invariant demonstration of the vanishing Love numbers for 4D Kerr black holes.
