Title: Conserved charges in the quantum simulation of integrable spin chains  
Abstract: With the advancement of quantum computing technologies, quantum simulation of many-body systems such as spin chains and lattice gauge theories will become an essential application target. In my talk, I will describe our work where we studied the quantum simulation of the spin-1/2 Heisenberg XXX spin chain. The model admits an integrable Trotterization so that the discretized time evolution preserves deformations of the original conserved charges. We implemented the integrable Trotterization on a real quantum computer and classical simulators. We then studied how quantum noise affects the time evolution of several conserved charges, and observed the decay of their expectation values. In addition, we examined the early-time behaviors, which can potentially be used to benchmark quantum devices and algorithms in the future. We also provided an efficient method to generate the conserved charges at higher orders.  Based on arXiv:2208.00576 with K. Maruyoshi, J. Pedersen, R. Suzuki, M. Yamazaki, and Y. Yoshida.
