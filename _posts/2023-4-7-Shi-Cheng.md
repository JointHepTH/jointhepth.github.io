Title:  3d N=2 theories and plumbing graphs: matter, gauging and dualities  
Abstract: Recently, a large class of 3d N = 2 gauge theories with mixed Chern-Simons levels, corresponding to plumbing 3-manifolds, has been identified. In this talks, we discuss abelian theories with chiral multiples. We find that such theories can be encoded in graphs, which generalize plumbing graphs, and various dualities in these theories can be represented in terms of transformations of such graphs. The operations we apply on 3d theories include gauging 0-form symmetries and integrating out gauge fields, which geometrically correspond to Kirby moves and its generalized versions. The dualities such as mirror triality and SQED-XYZ duality can be represented in terms of graphs, and enable us to find many new dual theories. We propose some new concepts such as ST-moves, gauged SQED-XYZ duality, and superpotential triangles. We can also discuss various phenomena in terms of brane webs.
