Title: Orientifold Calabi-Yau Manifolds and Type IIB String Vacua  
Abstract: We establish an orientifold Calabi-Yau threefold database for h11(X) <= 6.  We first determine the topology for each individual divisor, then identify and classify the proper involutions. Each of such involutions will result in an orientifold Calabi-Yau manifold. Then we clarify all possible fixed loci under the proper involution, thereby determining the locations of  types of O-planes. It is shown that under the proper involutions, one typically ends up with a system of O3/O7-planes, and most of these will further admit naive Type IIB string vacua. We also determine the splitting of the Hodge numbers. 

Furthermore, We use machine learning technique to search the polytope which can result in an orientifold Calabi-Yau hypersurface and the naive Type IIB string vacua.  The high accuracy indicates the orientifold symmetry may already encoded in the polytope structure. In the end, we make a try to use the trained neural networks model to go beyond the database and predict the orientifold signal of polytope for higher h11(X).
