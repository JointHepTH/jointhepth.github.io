Title: Black holes in chains    
Abstract: I will show that a simple experimental setup on a 1d spin chain captures the Hawking-Page transition, describing the formation of a black hole in supersymmetric AdS5. The result is based on an exact mathematical identity relating the black hole entropy to the averaged thermal Loschmidt echo of a Heisenberg chain with randomization of the coupling. 
While the spin chain describes only certain features of the Hawking-Page transition, I will establish the robustness of the correspondence when perturbative corrections are included, as well as when order parameters are considered.
The results provide a proof of concept that the Hawking-Page transition may be simulated on simple experimental devices.
Based on 2401.13963 in collaboration with D. Pérez-García and M. Tierz
