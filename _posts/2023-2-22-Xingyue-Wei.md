Title:  DE-type little strings from glued brane webs  
Abstract: Trivalent/quadrivalent gluing is a newly developed method to construct brane webs for 5d/6d supersymmetric gauge theories. In this talk, I will present the recent work with my collaborators, in which we constructed 6d N=(1,0) DE-type little string theories by trivalent/quadrivalent gluing and an additional compactification. I will talk about how to compute the partition functions of the DE-type little string theories by refined topological vertex formalism. Then I will talk about the affine Weyl group symmetries that are hidden in the glued brane webs of the DE-type little string theories, and how to utilize Weyl group symmetry to see the D,E symmetries as characters in the expansion of the partition functions, I will use D_4,D_5,E_6-type little string theories as examples.
