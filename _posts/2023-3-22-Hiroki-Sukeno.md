Title:  Quantum simulation of gauge theories from measuring entangled states  
Abstract: Quantum simulation of lattice gauge theory is expected to become a major application of near-term quantum devices. In this talk, I will present a quantum simulation scheme for lattice gauge theories motivated by Measurement-Based Quantum Computation [1], which we call Measurement-Based Quantum Simulation (MBQS). In MBQS, we consider preparing a resource state comprised of qubits whose entanglement structure reflects the spacetime structure of the simulated gauge theory. We then consider sequentially measuring qubits in the resource state in a certain adaptive manner, which drives the time evolution in the Hamiltonian lattice gauge theory. It turns out that the resource states we use for MBQS of Wegnerâ€™s models possess topological order protected by higher-form symmetries. These higher-form symmetries are also practically useful for error corrections to suppress contributions that violate gauge symmetries. This talk is based on my work with Takuya Okuda [2].
