Title: Narain CFTs from qudit stabilizer codes  
Abstract:We construct a discrete subset of Narain CFTs from quantum stabilizer codes with qudit (including qubit) systems whose dimension is a prime number. Our construction exploits three important relations. The first relation is between qudit stabilizer codes and classical codes. The second is between classical codes and Lorentzian lattices. The third is between Lorentzian lattices and Narain CFTs. In particular, we study qudit Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) codes as a special class of qudit stabilizer codes and the ensembles of the Narain code CFTs constructed from CSS codes. We obtain exact results for the averaged partition functions over the ensembles and discuss their implications for holographic duality.
