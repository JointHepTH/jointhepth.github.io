Speaker: Satoshi Nawata (Fudan U.)  
Title: Understanding DAHA from physics  
Abstract: Double affine Hecke algebra (DAHA) was introduced by Cherednik around the mid-90s. In the first half of the talk, I will explain DAHA of A_1 type and its representation from  2d sigma-model on Hitchin moduli space of once-punctured torus. This approach gives a geometric viewpoint of DAHA representations. In the second half, I will connect the 2d sigma model to 3d modularity and an algebra of line operator of a 4d N=2^* theory. The dimensional uplift provides a categorical perspective of DAHA and its representations.
