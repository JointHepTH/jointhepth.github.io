Speaker: Satoshi Nawata (Fudan)  
Title: Recent Progress in Instanton Counting    
Abstract: I will talk about the recent progress in our understanding of instanton counting in various gauge theories. The disucssion includes qq-characters and freezing, which reveals the novel relation between SO/Sp as well as SU+1AS and SU+1Sym. I also briefly discuss the issue of BPS jumping and the situation when the supersymmetric localization fails.
