Title: On the WKB approximation of a meromorphic ODE
Abstract: This talk gives an introduction to the Stokes phenomenon of a system of meromorphic ordinary differential equations. It then discusses the Stokes phenomenon in the WKB approximation of the equation, and its relation with the combinatorics on the associated spectral curves.
