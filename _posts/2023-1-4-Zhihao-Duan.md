Title: Towards a classification of fermionic rational conformal field theories  
Abstract:  Two-dimensional conformal field theories (CFTs) play an indispensable role in modern physics. Among them, rational CFTs enjoy particularly nice properties and hence are amenable to a possible classification. In this talk, I will review some recent progress towards classifying Rational CFTs with fermions using the holomorphic modular bootstrap method. As a main result, we successfully bootstrap theories having small number of characters, which already reveal interesting phenomena such as fermionization, SUSY enhancement and the moonshine of sporadic groups. Finally, I will explain how to make use of integrality and representation theory of finite groups to improve the classification.
