Speaker: Hao Zhang (IPMU)  
Title: Non-Invertible Duality Symmetry via Relative QFT and "Polarization Pair"  
Abstract: Non-invertible symmetry is a type of symmetry that does not obey any group law, and their recent discovery in 4D led to significant research interest both formally and phenomenologically. In this talk, we present a new general perspective on constructing non-invertible duality symmetries in the language of relative and absolute QFT, which not only reproduces non-invertible duality symmetries in 2D and 4D but also naturally identifies new non-invertible symmetries in 6D.
