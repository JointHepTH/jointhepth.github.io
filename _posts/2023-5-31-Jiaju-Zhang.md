Speaker: Jiaju Zhang (Tianjin University)  
Title: Emergence and breakdown of semiclassical picture in quasiparticle excited states  
Abstract: Quasiparticles are collective modes in many-body systems that can mimic semiclassical particles under some circumstances. I will talk about the emergence of semiclassical features in quasiparticle states of quantum chains using two quantum information quantities: entanglement entropy and subsystem distance. I will also demonstrate how the semiclassical description fails for a different measure, Shannon entropy.
