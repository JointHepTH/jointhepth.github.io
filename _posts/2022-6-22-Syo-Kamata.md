Speaker: Syo Kamata (Narodowe Centrum Badań Jądrowych (NCBJ))
Title: Resurgence theory is known as a method constructing a relationship among perturbative and nonperturbative physics based on asymptotic analysis. In this talk, we firstly introduce some important concepts in the resurgence theory, such as transseries, Borel resummation, and Stokes automorphism. Then, we consider exact WKB analysis, which is a sort of resurgence theory, for double- and triple-well potentials of the deformed SUSY quantum mechanics. We derive the (formal) exact quantization condition and their energy spectra via Borel resummation, and then discuss Borel summability of the energy spectra and nonperturbative contributions to them.
