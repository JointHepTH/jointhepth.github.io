Speaker: Ed Barnes (Virginia Tech)  
Title: Preparing Bethe ansatz states and other interesting many-body states on a quantum computer  
Abstract: The simulation of strongly correlated systems is one of the most exciting potential applications of quantum computers. There is hope that quantum algorithms could enable the simulation of classically intractable problems on near-term devices, but this requires significant reductions in quantum resources. I'll describe our efforts to lower these resource demands by leveraging Bethe's equations where possible or by utilizing adaptive wave function ansatze in the algorithms.
