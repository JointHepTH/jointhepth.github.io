Title:  The holography of duality in N = 4 Super-Yang-Mills-theory  
Abstract: Via the AdS/CFT correspondence, I discuss the gravity dual description of a class of N = 4 Super-Yang-Mills theories with su, so and sp gauge algebras, differing by the global 1-form symmetries and its associated line operator spectrum. These fine prints are encoded in the boundary conditions on the NSNS and RR 2-forms in type IIB string theory on AdS_5 x S^5 and AdS_5 x RP^5 and described by simple 5d topological field theories. The holographic description provides an elementary and intuitive understanding of the rich properties of these theories such as an intricate web of the SL(2,Z) duality, mixed 't Hooft anomalies as well as the existence of more varieties of N = 4 Super-Yang-Mills theories distinguished by the boundary conditions on the 1-form and 3-form gauge fields.
