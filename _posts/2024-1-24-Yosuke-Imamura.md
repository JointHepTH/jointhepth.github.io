Title: Giant Graviton Expansions for Orbifolds and Orientifolds    
Abstract: We study giant graviton expansions of the superconformal index of 4d supersymmetric theories. In general, a giant graviton expansion is given as a multiple sum over wrapping numbers, but it was found by Gaiotto and Lee that for N=4 SYM it can be reduced to a simple sum. We find in many examples of orbifold and orientifold theories such reduction occurs, and theories defined with different orbifold/orientifold projections are connected by giant graviton expansions.
