Speaker: Tomoyuki Arakawa (RIMS, Kyoto University)  
Title: 4D/2D duality and representation theory    
Abstract: This talk is about some recent physical theory (4D/2D duality) that relates representations of some algebras (VOAs) with theoretical physics (4 dimensional N=2 superconformal field theory) and geometry (symplectic singularities).

More precisely, I will talk about the 4D/2D duality discovered by Beem et al. that associates a VOA to any 4 dimensional N=2 superconformal field theory. The corresponding VOA has many interesting properties, and in particular, it may be regarded as a refinement of the Higgs branch of the 4D theory, which is believed to be a symplectic singularities
