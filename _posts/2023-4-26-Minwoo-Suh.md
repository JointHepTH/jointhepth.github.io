Title:  Branes wrapped on spindles and disks  
Abstract: Recently, we have observed construction of new supersymmetric AdS solutions from branes wrapped on spindles and disks. They preserve supersymmetry in a way which generalizes the conventional topological twist which was very useful to field theory and supergravity for years. They also provide a new addition of supersymmetric black hole solutions to the recent activity of microstate counting of AdS black holes. In this talk, I will review the AdS solutions from branes wrapped on spindles and disks. Then I will explain two recent developments of gravitational blocks and spindle solutions with baryonic charges.
