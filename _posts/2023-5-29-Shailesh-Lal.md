Speaker: Shailesh Lal (BIMSA)  
Title:  A Neural Networks Solver for R Matrices  
Abstract: We describe how neural networks may be used to learn solutions to the Yang-Baxter Equation using 2d spin chains of difference form as a concrete example. the talk is based on arxiv:2304.07247, which is joint work with Suvajit Majumder and Evgeny Skvortsov.
